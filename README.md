# E-Newsletter Platform for Educational Institutions

UNL_ENews is a micro-news management platform for funneling news and building
electronic newsletters.

Users from the community submit news stories into a "Newsroom" where administrators
build an electronic newsletter, which can be distributed through email.

News Stories can include:

 * Quick summary (required)
 * Full text

Use scripts within the scripts directory to create new newsrooms
